Certainly, there are multiple ways to establish a MySQLi database connection in PHP, which can be a bit confusing. Here's a summary of common approaches:

1. **Using Object-Oriented MySQLi:**

   - **Creating a New MySQLi Object:**
     ```php
     $mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database_name");
     if ($mysqli->connect_error) {
         die("Connection failed: " . $mysqli->connect_error);
     }
     ```

   - **Using an Existing MySQLi Object:**
     If you already have a MySQLi object created, you can use it for database operations without re-establishing the connection.
     ```php
     $mysqli->select_db("database_name");
     ```

2. **Using Procedural MySQLi:**

   - **mysqli_connect:**
     ```php
     $conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "username", "password", "database_name");
     if (!$conn) {
         die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
     }
     ```

   - **mysqli_select_db:**
     After establishing the connection, you can select the database using `mysqli_select_db`.
     ```php
     mysqli_select_db($conn, "database_name");
     ```

3. **Using MySQLi and Prepared Statements:**
   If you plan to use prepared statements for better security, you'll create the connection as in the first Object-Oriented example, then use the connection object for prepared statements.

   ```php
   $mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database_name");
   if ($mysqli->connect_error) {
       die("Connection failed: " . $mysqli->connect_error);
   }

   // Use $mysqli for prepared statements
   ```

In summary, here are some key points to remember:

- Use the Object-Oriented or Procedural style based on your coding preference.
- Creating a new MySQLi object or using `mysqli_connect` both establish a connection to the database.
- The database name can be specified during connection or later using `select_db()`.

Choose the style that you find most readable and maintainable for your project, and stick to it for consistency.
