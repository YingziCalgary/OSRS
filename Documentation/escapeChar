"\n": Represents a newline character.
"\t": Represents a tab character.
"\r": Represents a carriage return character.
"\"": Represents a double quotation mark within a double-quoted string.
"\\": Represents a literal backslash character within a double-quoted string.
When you use double quotation marks (") to define a string in PHP, escape sequences are interpreted, 
meaning that "\n" is treated as a newline character, "\t" as a tab character, and so on. 
Single quotation marks (') treat the content as a literal string, so '\n' would be treated as the 
characters \ and n and not as a newline character.
