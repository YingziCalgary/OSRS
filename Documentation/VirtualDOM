Yes, that's a good way to think about it. The virtual DOM (VDOM) in React serves as a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. It's like a clone or a shadow DOM that React uses for experimentation and calculation before making any changes to the real DOM.

Here's how it works in more detail:

1. **Initial Rendering**: When you create a React component, React generates a virtual DOM tree that mirrors the structure of the actual DOM. However, this virtual DOM is not directly rendered to the screen.

2. **State and Prop Changes**: When the state or props of a React component change (due to user interactions or other factors), React doesn't immediately update the real DOM. Instead, it re-renders a new virtual DOM based on the updated state and props.

3. **Virtual DOM Diffing**: React then performs a process called "diffing" to compare the new virtual DOM with the previous one. It identifies the specific differences (changes) between the two virtual DOM representations.

4. **Reconciliation**: After identifying the differences, React determines the minimal set of changes required to bring the virtual DOM in sync with the updated state. This process is known as reconciliation.

5. **Updating the Real DOM**: Finally, React applies the identified changes to the real DOM. However, React is optimized to make these changes as efficiently as possible, minimizing the impact on the actual page rendering.

By using the virtual DOM, React can avoid direct and potentially costly manipulation of the real DOM for each small change in the UI. Instead, it calculates and batches these changes, resulting in improved performance and a smoother user experience.

So, in essence, the virtual DOM acts as a buffer or intermediary layer that allows React to experiment with UI changes before committing them to the real DOM.
