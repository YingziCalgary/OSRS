No, you do not NEED Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) for styling in a React app. While Sass is a popular and powerful CSS preprocessor that offers features like variables, nesting, and mixins, you can style React apps perfectly well using plain CSS or CSS modules.

Here are some options for styling in a React app:

1. **Plain CSS**: You can write regular CSS files (`.css`) and import them into your React components. This is a straightforward way to style your components.

2. **CSS Modules**: CSS modules, as mentioned earlier, provide scoped and modular CSS for React components. They are a great way to encapsulate styles within components and avoid global scope issues.

3. **Sass/SCSS**: If you are familiar with Sass and prefer to use it, you can incorporate Sass into your React project. You can use loaders like `sass-loader` to compile Sass/SCSS files to CSS during the build process.

4. **Styled-components**: Styled-components is a popular CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write styles as JavaScript code directly within your React components. It provides a different approach to styling, offering benefits like dynamic styling based on props.

5. **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that you can use with React. It focuses on providing a set of utility classes that you can apply directly to HTML elements.

The choice of styling method depends on your project's requirements, your team's preferences, and your familiarity with the tools. You can use plain CSS, CSS modules, Sass, or other CSS-in-JS libraries based on what suits your project best. Each approach has its strengths and can be effective for building React applications.
