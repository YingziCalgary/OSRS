Here's how the props correspond to screen sizes:

xs: Extra small screens (less than 576px wide)
sm: Small screens (576px and wider)
md: Medium screens (768px and wider)
lg: Large screens (992px and wider)
xl: Extra large screens (1200px and wider)

For example, xs={6}, you're specifying that the column should take up half of the available width on extra small screens (less than 576px wide).
